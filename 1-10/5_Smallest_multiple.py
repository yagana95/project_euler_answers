"""
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
"""
#So 2520 is just 1*5*7*8*9
#Then the smallest positive number will be 1*5*7*9*11*13*16*17*19

print(1*5*7*9*11*13*16*17*19)
#That's because we have to find the biggest factor of each multiple so the
#result is divisible by all of them.
